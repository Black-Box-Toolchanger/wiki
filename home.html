<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-huge"><strong>Welcome!</strong></span></h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Blackbox3D.XYZ is the official home of the Open-Source Blackbox Tool Changing 3D Printer</h2>

<h1><strong>What is a Blackbox?</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><br>Blackbox is a tool changing 3D Printer originally designed by Marc Schöemann in 2016 to overcome the issue on properly integrating flexible materials with rigid materials for the production of flexible robotic appendages. The current revision of Blackbox was released as an open source project in 2017 and today we are happy to bring you the first of the Blackbox Family of tool changers - Blackbox CE (Community Edition)</p>
<p>Through community participation and engagement we aim to further refine the platform with options for industrial, aerospace, and other applications!</p>
<h2><strong>Is there a kit available for parts?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><br>Yes - Blackbox is now supported by <a href="https://www.kb-3d.com/store">KB3D</a> ! Parts are available individually or as comprehensive kits. We continue to work the <a href="http://ldomotors.com/">LDO Motors</a> , <a href="https://mandalaroseworks.com/">Mandala Rose Works</a> , and other trusted community vendors to expand your options.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>This machine looks intimidating, can I build one?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><br>Yes, but maybe. Blackbox has some new (to most) design elements that will push you to learn about systems you may not have dealt with before. In general though, the recommendations from other DIY printer build communities translate well. Those are typically as follows:</p>
<p><u>This probably shouldn’t be your first 3D printer.</u> There are always exceptions, but the experience you have will likely lean on your previously acquired skills from using and maintaining other machines.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite our best efforts to guide you along, every machine will be different. From the quality of the printed parts to the nuances of your particular configuration. You should be comfortable with the fact that your attention to detail and where-with-all will determine the final product.</p>
<p>You will learn a ton, and probably pick up some new tools to make your life easier. Learning takes time, and so will your build. This is not an 8 hour build!</p>
<p>We have a well-established community full of friendly, helpful, and skilled members that can help you with any hurdles along the way. The documentation on this wiki will be your number one resource for nearly everything.</p>
<h2><strong>Can I contribute, and how?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>Absolutely. Blackbox is free to the world, courtesy of Marc Schöemann (Founder) and the development team. We encourage everyone to give back to the project however possible. Here are some ideas:</p>
<p>Sharing of modifications made to your machine that you think improve the experience or broaden the use case&nbsp;<br>CAD optimization and contribution&nbsp;<br>Bug fixes, error reporting, and feedback/suggestions&nbsp;<br>Documentation Contribution!&nbsp;<br>Help your peers where possible&nbsp;<br>A small donation, or purchasing parts through our official store at <a href="https://www.kb-3d.com/store">KB3D</a>.&nbsp;<br>Join the Discord community <a href="http://www.discord.gg/fVtg7ga">Here</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where can I find the latest and most up-to-date information on Blackbox?&nbsp;<br>This wiki page along with our Discord should be your destination for all announcements and official documentation. <strong><u>We have satellite pages all over the web in varying states of out-dated.</u></strong><u> </u>Blackbox has been a long term project with multiple iterations to achieve refinement. We are actively working to update all other blogs/pages.</p>
<h1><br><strong>Features and Specs:</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h3><strong>General:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Blackbox is a fully open source design years in the making. Proven results over multiple iterations creates a solid foundation for a community driven machine limited only by our imaginations.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Mechanical:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Build Area = 300x300x275(Z)</p>
<p>Tool-Changing = Up to 5 chassis mounted tools</p>
<p>FDM = Up to 5 direct drive FDM tool heads with excellent positional accuracy via kinematic coupling. Support for multiple hot end configurations. Unique X-axis mounted extruder motor saves cost AND weight.</p>
<p>Watercooling = Passive watercooling of all tools at all times in addition to a passively cooled extruder stepper</p>
<p>CoreXY Motion System = Intuitive belt routing with easy to use tensioning system.</p>
<p>Belt Driven Z-Axis = Extremely fast belted Z axis with counterweight system.&nbsp;<br><br>Enclosure = Fully enclosed build volume (Hood Optional)<br><br>REPRAP = Designed in the spirit of Reprap utilizing easily obtainable and 3D printable parts.</p>
<h3><strong>Electronics:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Wiring = Designed with clean and functional wiring in mind. Duet 3 Electronics with FEP wire harness.</p>
<p>Bed Leveling and End Stops =Designed to use mechanical switches or digital endstops on XY. Mechanical switch or Duet IR Probe for mesh.</p>
<p>Tool Offsets: Fully automated tool offset configuration using the late Danal Estes TAMV alignment system run from a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Heated Bed: Mains heated and ultra flat with options for embedded magnets</p>
